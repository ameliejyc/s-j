    <h3>Have you met good ol’ Sarah and James?<br />
They’re getting wed and will take each others’ names<br />
Except I don’t know that’s true<br />
Not the wedding but the surnames situ<br />
So let’s just keep calling them Sarah and James.

    <h3>There was once a girl called Sarah<br />
James saw her said no girl is fairer<br />
So he bought her a ring<br />
Plonked it on her right fing’<br />
To make sure no one can share her.</h3>

    <h3>There was once a tall man called James<br />
He liked to win all the board games<br />
One day he went on a date<br />
Got his heart in checkmate<br />
But he won in finding his dame.</h3>

    <h3>Sarah Edwards and James Peet<br />
A nicer pair you’re unlikely to meet<br />
If they lived in a shoe<br />
They’d smell like one terrible brew<br />
But they don’t so that line’s obsolete.

    <h3>James and Sarah<br />
We always knew they’d get married<br />
No matter how much he’s a dingle<br />
No matter how much they dallied.</h3>
    <section class="verse">
      <h3>Sarah and James<br />
A pair so graceful and tall<br />
She's a master architect<br />
He mastered gamers’ fall.

      <h3>Jason and Oakley<br />
They’re not in this poem<br />
But if they were<br />
You’d be sure to know’em.

      <h3>Peet and Edwards<br />
Congratulations on tying the knot<br />
We hope you receive nice things<br />
Things you don’t already got.

      <h3>Edwards and Peet<br />
Here’s to your wedding day.<br />
Thanks for sharing the love<br />
If that’s not too gay to say.

      <h3>We wish you a lifetime of love<br />
And a happy home<br />
That we can come visit<br />
As your loyal adoring gnomes.
